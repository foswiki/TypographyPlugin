This plugin can be used to improve the typography of TML text.

---++ Syntax Rules and Examples

| *Syntax* | *Generates* | *Description* |
|  &lt;<nop>&lt;  |  <font face="Webdings">&nbsp;</font>  | Non-breaking space |
|  &gt;<nop>&gt;  |  <font face="Webdings">4</font>  | Little arrow |
|  -<nop>-<nop>-  |  &mdash;  | Em dash* |
|  -<nop>-  |  &ndash;  | En dash* |
|  &lt;expand&gt;WikiWord(s)&lt;/expand&gt;  |  Wiki Words  | Expands wiki words <br> *Hint*: Use in navigation/title bars |

Dashes
   * For an ordinary hyphen use "-" (don't use the quotes).
   * For a range of numbers use the en dash "--" as in 2--8 (named because it is as wide as n).
   * To indicate a parenthetic expression use the em dash "---" (as wide as m).
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash for more details on the proper use of dashes

Quotation marks (&quot;) and apostrophes (&apos;) are also converted to rounded quotes.

(Em/en-dash and rounded quotation/apostrophes are only done if client browser is known to handle Unicode characters appropriately.)
